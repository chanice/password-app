#Vault Master

**Vault Master** is an interactive app that allows the user to store their very own passwords.
 
The idea of this app is to allow users to:

1. Login to their accounts and then head to the passwords dedicated 
page where they will store a password of their choosing. 

2. The app also allows the user to enter the title of where the password is coming from to help organize their passwords. 

3. There is also a sign up page for new users to signup for an account to start storing their passwords.
